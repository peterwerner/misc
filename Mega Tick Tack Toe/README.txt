Mega Tick Tack Toe:

This is the classic game of tick tack toe, but bigger and better than ever.
It is a 5x5 board, where you can either win by getting a 5-in-a-row, or by getting the most points.
Points are awarded as such:  3-in-a-row: 1 point,  4-in-a-row: 3 points,  5-in-a-row:  auto-victory!

! TickTackToe.java does not handle any input.
! It includes the game implementation and a GUI.

Test.java handles input via command line

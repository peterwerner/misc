Dynamic lighting from scratch (Applet):

Use the arrow keys to move around the light source

A small experiment in dynamic lighting using standard Java libraries.
This is not meant to be a robust solution for lighting in games - 
It's just a fun little test done without any prior knowledge of raytracing / lighting.

Programmed in Java using Eclipse

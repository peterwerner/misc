IAGO - Flip the Dots (for Android):

play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peternwerner.iagogame

Touch a dot to flip it between its colored and grey states.
When all the dots are colored, you win. Sound easy? Here's the catch -
when you flip one dot, dots that are directly connected to it will also flip.
Put your mind to the test and keep playing to unlock progressively more difficult puzzles.

Programmed in Java using Eclipse and the Android SDK

Everything is done programatically (graphics included) so as to make the application as light as possible.
